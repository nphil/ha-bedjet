"""BedJet V3 async device client: connection lifecycle, watchdog, and command confirmation.

See ``pybedjet/codec.py`` for the wire-protocol byte map (frame/tail decoding,
command encoding) - that module is pure and has no I/O. This module owns only
*when* to connect, read, write, and reconnect over a real BLE link shared
through Home Assistant's ``bluetooth`` component (which may route through a
remote ESPHome Bluetooth proxy) via ``bleak``/``bleak_retry_connector``.

Single-slot connection model
================================================================
A BedJet V3 accepts exactly one BLE connection and stops advertising while
connected (ground truth, verified live against a real unit). An advertisement
is therefore a positive signal that the slot is currently free, and is what
drives reconnection - see `_connect_supervisor`. `hold_connection` is the
switch a user flips to voluntarily give the slot back to the BedJet mobile
app without unloading the whole integration.

16-bit CCCD note [answering the Contract's explicit question]: ESPHome's own
`BedJetHub::write_notify_config_descriptor_` (bedjet_hub.cpp:420-434) exists
only because ESP-IDF's raw `esp_ble_gattc` API and ESPHome's `ble_client`
component write an 8-bit value to the notify Client Characteristic
Configuration Descriptor where the BLE spec requires 16 bits, forcing ESPHome
to redo that write itself. That is an ESP-IDF/ESPHome implementation detail,
not a BedJet protocol requirement. `bleak`'s `BleakClient.start_notify()`
already performs a spec-correct 16-bit CCCD write on every backend; this
module does nothing special here and needs nothing special.
